These data quantitatively demonstrate specific biotinylation of HEK-293T cells expressing cognate peptide-MHC complexes by activated Jurkat cells, with statistical analyses showing significant differences in BV421 fluorescence intensity between cognate and non-cognate interactions. The dataset includes comparative results for peptide-pulsed and endogenously expressed antigens, a list of potential cross-reactive epitopes identified through peptide library screening, and confirmation data showing activation profiles of TCR-MAP Jurkat cells against newly identified peptides. This comprehensive dataset provides a detailed characterization of TCR specificity and cross-reactivity, enabling further analysis and interpretation of TCR-peptide-MHC interactions.",

The constraint specifically mentions \"live\" cells, and there's nothing in the material description that suggests the cells are not alive. So this aspect is in agreement.\n\n2. HLA-null HEK-293T cells:\n   The material explicitly states that the cells are \"HLA-null HEK-293T cells\". This matches exactly with the constraint. So this aspect is in agreement.\n\n3. Cell clones:\n   The material mentions \"clonal populations\", which indicates that these are indeed clones. This matches the constraint. So this aspect is in agreement.\n\n4. Single-cell suspension:\n   This is where we might have a potential disagreement. The material describes cells in a 96-well plate, which typically contain adherent cells or small colonies, not necessarily a single-cell suspension. However, the constraint requires a single-cell suspension suitable for flow cytometry. The cells in the plate would need to be detached and resuspended to meet this constraint.\n\n5. Suitable for flow cytometry analysis:\n   As mentioned in point 4, the cells as described in the material (in a 96-well plate) are not immediately ready for flow cytometry. They would need to be processed further to create a single-cell suspension.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile the material matches most of the constraints, it doesn't explicitly meet the requirement of being in a single-cell suspension suitable for flow cytometry.

Single-cell suspension:\nThe material states the cells are in liquid suspension culture medium. This agrees with the constraint.\n\n3. Standard cell culture medium:\nThe material mentions the cells are in culture medium. This agrees with the constraint.\n\n4. Concentration of approximately 10^6 cells/mL:\nThe material does not specify the cell concentration. However, this doesn't explicitly disagree with the constraint.\n\n5. Maintained at room temperature or 37\u00b0C:\nThe material states the cells are maintained at an appropriate temperature for cell viability. This is consistent with the constraint, as both room temperature and 37\u00b0C are appropriate for short-term Jurkat cell viability.\n\n6. Pure culture:\nThe material mentions that the culture contains a mixture of successfully transduced cells and potentially some non-transduced cells. This might not fully agree with the \"pure culture\" constraint, as non-transduced cells may be present.\n\n7. Unstimulated state:\nThe material does not mention any stimulation of the cells. The cells are described as being in an actively growing state, which is consistent with an unstimulated state for Jurkat cells.\n\nAfter considering all aspects, there is one potential disagreement with the constraints: the purity of the culture. The material suggests there might be a mixture of transduced and non-transduced cells, which may not meet the \"pure culture\" requirement.\n\nHowever, since this is a minor discrepancy and all other aspects align with or do not explicitly contradict the constraints, we can consider this as generally meeting the form constraints.\n\nCorrect: True",
